# Framing
## Terminology:
* **Label** - the thing we are predicting (i.e. y in linear regression).
* **Feature** - is the input variable (i.e x in linear regression). May have multiple.
* **Examples** - a particular instance of data:
    * **Labeled Example** - includes features and the label. Use this to train (i.e. label could be "spam" or "not spam")
    * **Unlabeled Example** - includes just features - can be used to predict the label on unlabeled examples. 
* **Models** - relationship between features and label
    * **Training** - Showing the model labeled examples for it to learn relationships between features and labell.
    * **Inference** - applying trained model to unlabelled examples.
* **Regression** - predicts continous values ("what is the vaule of a house?" - "probability user will click on this add?")
* **Classification** - predicts discrete values ("Is this email spam?" - "is this a dog, cat or chicken?")

## Other notes:

Think about label reliability!

Useful features are quantifiable - subjective non measurables such as "adoration" are not!
